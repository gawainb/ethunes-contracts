# Ethunes Contracts
- This is the very first version of Ethunes. Ethunes is decentralized music publishing right and licenseing NFT platform. Musicians mint their mp3 songs at ERC-721 tokens. Owner of this token will have the right to issue different categories of license such as non-commercial, or modification which then could bepurchased in the form of ERC-1155 tokens. Buyers can purchase as many as they desire. Later then can also sell this ownership on secondary marketplaces like opensea.

Producers, music companies or individual collectors can also earn incomings from the new licenses sold. Original musicians will still receive royalties.
